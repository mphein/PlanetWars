Planet Wars Behavior Tree

A python bot that plays Planet Wars using Behavior Trees.  Planet Wars is a real-time strategy game in which you have to conquer a galaxy, planet by planet. Each planet produces ships per turn, and ships can be used to take over other planets from the enemy or neutral forces (similar to Galcon). 

Created a bot that utilizes a behavior tree to make decisions on player turns. This behavior tree uses a combination checks, sequences, and selectors to make decisions.

Example behaviors include attacking weakest enemy planet, spreading from strongest player planet to empty neutral planet, or reinforcing other planets.

Challenges: Figuring out general strategies and decision planning for the bot. Planning out to weave these behaviors together to create a dynamic bot.

Learned: Structuring and creating behavior trees. Thinking about gameplay from a generalist decision making perspective. How might we want a bot to play to have a fighting chance against the average player?
